# How Leo uses GitHub issues 

To keep a focused list of immediate actions, some Leo devs. like to close "wishlist" and
longer term issues, and use tags like `Wishlist`, or `Enhancment` to keep track of them.

So a Leo GitHub issue being closed without action doesn't mean they're won't be action,
just that it's not part of the current set fo `Bug` issues being most immediately addressed.
